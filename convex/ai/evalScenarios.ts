/**
 * Shared eval scenarios for the AI coach.
 *
 * Two callers consume these scenarios:
 *  1. `coachEvals.test.ts` — fast prompt-only smoke harness (`npm test`).
 *  2. `scripts/evals/phoenix/*.ts` — Phoenix Cloud datasets and PR-time smoke.
 *
 * Keep scenarios organized by capability tag so the Phoenix dashboard can
 * slice failure rates per capability and the nightly run can filter subsets.
