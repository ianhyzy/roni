# PR Review Learnings

Last reviewed: 2026-05-31

A running log of recurring, legitimate issues raised in pull-request review that
agents (and humans) should pre-empt. Each entry records the **problem**, **why
it matters**, and a **preventive check** to run before opening a PR. Entries are
distilled from real review threads — PR numbers are cited so the original
discussion can be traced.

These are conventions and checklists, not mechanically enforced rules. When one
conflicts with the AGENTS.md [Priority Hierarchy](../AGENTS.md#priority-hierarchy),
the hierarchy wins.

## 1. Don't let broad `catch` blocks swallow auth-expiry or non-transient errors

**Seen in:** #377, #354 (4+ review threads, the most repeated finding)

**Problem.** A fetch helper wraps a Tonal call in a broad `catch` that converts
_every_ failure into a benign empty result (`return []`, `return null`, or a
fake terminal page like `{ activities: [], pageSize: 0, pgTotal: 0 }`). This
silently absorbs:

- `TonalSessionExpiredError` / 401-refresh-failure errors thrown by
  `withTokenRetry`, and
- unexpected internal faults (e.g. `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` misconfiguration,
  decrypt/cache-query errors).

**Why it matters.** Auth-expiry is a _signal_, not "no data." Swallowing it:

- makes `backfillUserHistoryWorkflow` treat an empty page as a successful
  terminal page, mark `syncStatus: "complete"`, and permanently under-backfill
  the account (#377);
- causes user-facing flows (strength trend, progressive overload, check-ins) to
  render a normal "Not enough data" state instead of routing the user to
  reconnect (#377, #354);
- turns operational outages into "detail missing," so they never surface in
  Sentry and are far harder to detect (#354).

**Preventive checks.**

- Only suppress **known transient** Tonal/network failures. Re-throw
  `TonalSessionExpiredError` and other auth/session errors so reconnect paths
  fire, and re-throw unexpected internal faults so they reach Sentry.
- Before adding `catch { return [] }` to a data-fetch helper, list its callers
  and confirm none rely on the error propagating (e.g.
  `fetchWorkoutHistoryOrEmpty` in `convex/progressiveOverload.ts` intentionally
  rethrows session-expired errors).
- State the error contract for each fetch helper explicitly: which errors return
  empty, which propagate.
- Note: the canonical reconnect surface for expired sessions is the
  profile-driven `StatusBanner` (`me.tonalTokenExpired`), so an `internalAction`
  may legitimately return empty to avoid Sentry noise — but a _user-facing_
  query/action must not mask the auth failure (#377).

## 2. Make tests exercise the real production path, with valid domain values

**Seen in:** #375, #354, #392, #371

**Problem.** Tests pass while the production path is broken because they don't
drive the real handler:

- #375 — the regression test stubbed a message with `status: "streaming"`, but
  the persisted `MessageDoc` status domain is `pending | success | failed`
  (`streaming` is a UI-only state). The test passed, yet the production fix never
  fired: `components.agent.messages.finalizeMessage` only mutates `pending`
  rows, so the new "streaming" finalize path was a no-op in prod.
- #354 — `simulateFetchWorkoutDetailCatch` _duplicated_ the catch logic in the
  test instead of calling the real `fetchWorkoutDetail` handler, so a regression
  in the real code could ship green.
- #392 — fixtures derived `expiresAt` from `Date.now()`, making tests
  time-dependent (violates the "tests must be deterministic" rule).

**Why it matters.** A test that doesn't touch the code under change gives false
confidence — the headline bug the PR claims to fix can remain unfixed.

**Preventive checks.**

- Drive assertions through the **real exported handler** (`fn._handler` with a
  mocked `ActionCtx`), mocking only at true boundaries (`global fetch`, DB,
  external APIs) — never duplicate or mock the internal function under test.
- Use only **valid domain values** in fixtures. Cross-check enum/status domains
  against the schema; a status the system can never persist won't exercise the
  real branch.
- Keep fixtures deterministic: fixed numeric constants instead of `Date.now()` /
  `Math.random()`.
- Prefer Zod `safeParse` over `as` casts when normalizing test input — an
  unchecked cast lets a wrong-shaped value (e.g. a string where an array is
  expected) pass `.length`-style assertions (#371).
- When a fix changes production behavior, confirm the test fails _without_ the
  fix before relying on it.

## 3. Match model IDs by family, not exact equality, on cost/budget paths

**Seen in:** #368 (multiple threads)

**Problem.** Pricing lookups used exact `===` on the model ID. Dated or
provider-suffixed variants (`claude-sonnet-4-6-20250514`, OpenRouter/OpenAI
aliases, `*-preview` overrides) no longer matched, so `getModelPricing` returned
`undefined`.

**Why it matters.** Missing pricing flows into `estimateAttemptCostUsd` →
`totalCostUsd` recorded as missing → treated as **zero** in circuit-breaker
aggregation. Spend thresholds and `budgetCapStopCondition` are silently bypassed,
weakening BYOK cost protection exactly on failed attempts. Related traps in the
same PR: routing complex/fallback turns through a model priced only at the _low_
prompt-size tier under-estimates large-context spend, and promoting fallback
attempts back to the `programming` tier re-triggers the failures fallback exists
to avoid.

**Preventive checks.**

- Match priced model IDs by **exact ID or hyphen-suffixed family prefix**, and
  add coverage for dated/aliased variants.
- Provide a **conservative fallback rate** for unknown IDs (especially
  user-supplied OpenRouter overrides) so failed attempts always contribute spend.
- For enforcement paths (budget cap, circuit breaker), price with the
  **worst-case / high prompt-size tier**, not the cheapest tier.
- Keep fallback routing pinned to the selected fallback tier; don't let a tool
  call escalate a fallback turn back onto the tier it was escaping.
- Keep `docs/ai/model-policy.md` aligned with the rates the runtime estimator
  actually enforces.

## 4. Derive watchdog/sweep timers from the action cap, not optimistic guesses

**Seen in:** #412

**Problem.** The stuck-message watchdog was scheduled _before_ provider
resolution, prompt/context building, and `streamWithRetry` (three 180s
attempts). The assistant row for the final attempt could be created more than
five minutes after the timer started; if that attempt was then killed by the
600s action cap, the single sweep saw the row as younger than
`STUCK_MESSAGE_GRACE_MS`, skipped it, and queued no later sweep — leaving the
spinner stuck indefinitely.

**Why it matters.** A self-healing mechanism that can fire before the thing it
heals exists (or before it has aged into the grace window) silently fails on
exactly the slow/retried turns it was built for.

**Preventive checks.**

- Derive sweep delays from the **Convex action cap**
  (`CONVEX_ACTION_MAX_MS = 10m`): set `GRACE = cap + margin` and
  `WATCHDOG_DELAY = grace + cap + margin`, so even a final-attempt row created at
  the very end of the action's life has aged past the grace window before the
  sweep fires.
- Add a regression test asserting the invariant (e.g.
  `WATCHDOG_DELAY - GRACE > CONVEX_ACTION_MAX_MS`) so it can't silently regress.
- Prefer a single larger fixed delay over self-rescheduling to keep the sweep
  stateless — but if you keep it single-shot, prove the timing window covers the
  worst-case retry path.

## How to use this log

- Before opening a PR that touches **Tonal fetch helpers, AI cost/budget paths,
  test fixtures, or scheduled sweeps**, skim the matching section above.
- When a review surfaces a _new_ recurring, legitimate gap (not stylistic, not
  one-off), add an entry here with the PR reference so the next agent inherits
  the lesson.
