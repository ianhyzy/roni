# PR Review Learnings

Last reviewed: 2026-06-11

A running log of recurring, legitimate issues raised in pull-request review that
agents (and humans) should pre-empt. Each entry records the **problem**, **why
it matters**, and a **preventive check** to run before opening a PR. Entries are
distilled from real review threads — PR numbers are cited so the original
discussion can be traced.

These are conventions and checklists, not mechanically enforced rules. When one
conflicts with the AGENTS.md [Priority Hierarchy](../AGENTS.md#priority-hierarchy),
the hierarchy wins.

## 1. Don't let broad `catch` blocks swallow auth-expiry or non-transient errors

**Seen in:** #377, #354 (4+ review threads, the most repeated finding)

**Problem.** A fetch helper wraps a Tonal call in a broad `catch` that converts
_every_ failure into a benign empty result (`return []`, `return null`, or a
fake terminal page like `{ activities: [], pageSize: 0, pgTotal: 0 }`). This
silently absorbs:

- `TonalSessionExpiredError` / 401-refresh-failure errors thrown by
  `withTokenRetry`, and
- unexpected internal faults (e.g. `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` misconfiguration,
  decrypt/cache-query errors).

**Why it matters.** Auth-expiry is a _signal_, not "no data." Swallowing it:

- makes `backfillUserHistoryWorkflow` treat an empty page as a successful
  terminal page, mark `syncStatus: "complete"`, and permanently under-backfill
  the account (#377);
- causes user-facing flows (strength trend, progressive overload, check-ins) to
  render a normal "Not enough data" state instead of routing the user to
  reconnect (#377, #354);
- turns operational outages into "detail missing," so they never surface in
  Sentry and are far harder to detect (#354).

**Preventive checks.**

- Only suppress **known transient** Tonal/network failures. Re-throw
  `TonalSessionExpiredError` and other auth/session errors so reconnect paths
  fire, and re-throw unexpected internal faults so they reach Sentry.
- Before adding `catch { return [] }` to a data-fetch helper, list its callers
  and confirm none rely on the error propagating (e.g.
  `fetchWorkoutHistoryOrEmpty` in `convex/progressiveOverload.ts` intentionally
  rethrows session-expired errors).
- State the error contract for each fetch helper explicitly: which errors return
  empty, which propagate.
- Note: the canonical reconnect surface for expired sessions is the
  profile-driven `StatusBanner` (`me.tonalTokenExpired`), so an `internalAction`
  may legitimately return empty to avoid Sentry noise — but a _user-facing_
  query/action must not mask the auth failure (#377).

## 2. Make tests exercise the real production path, with valid domain values

**Seen in:** #375, #354, #392, #371

**Problem.** Tests pass while the production path is broken because they don't
drive the real handler:

- #375 — the regression test stubbed a message with `status: "streaming"`, but
  the persisted `MessageDoc` status domain is `pending | success | failed`
  (`streaming` is a UI-only state). The test passed, yet the production fix never
  fired: `components.agent.messages.finalizeMessage` only mutates `pending`
  rows, so the new "streaming" finalize path was a no-op in prod.
- #354 — `simulateFetchWorkoutDetailCatch` _duplicated_ the catch logic in the
  test instead of calling the real `fetchWorkoutDetail` handler, so a regression
  in the real code could ship green.
- #392 — fixtures derived `expiresAt` from `Date.now()`, making tests
  time-dependent (violates the "tests must be deterministic" rule).

**Why it matters.** A test that doesn't touch the code under change gives false
confidence — the headline bug the PR claims to fix can remain unfixed.

**Preventive checks.**

- Drive assertions through the **real exported handler** (`fn._handler` with a
  mocked `ActionCtx`), mocking only at true boundaries (`global fetch`, DB,
  external APIs) — never duplicate or mock the internal function under test.
- Use only **valid domain values** in fixtures. Cross-check enum/status domains
  against the schema; a status the system can never persist won't exercise the
  real branch.
- Keep fixtures deterministic: fixed numeric constants instead of `Date.now()` /
  `Math.random()`.
- Prefer Zod `safeParse` over `as` casts when normalizing test input — an
  unchecked cast lets a wrong-shaped value (e.g. a string where an array is
  expected) pass `.length`-style assertions (#371).
- When a fix changes production behavior, confirm the test fails _without_ the
  fix before relying on it.

## 3. Match model IDs by family, not exact equality, on cost/budget paths

**Seen in:** #368 (multiple threads)

**Problem.** Pricing lookups used exact `===` on the model ID. Dated or
provider-suffixed variants (`claude-sonnet-4-6-20250514`, OpenRouter/OpenAI
aliases, `*-preview` overrides) no longer matched, so `getModelPricing` returned
`undefined`.

**Why it matters.** Missing pricing flows into `estimateAttemptCostUsd` →
`totalCostUsd` recorded as missing → treated as **zero** in circuit-breaker
aggregation. Spend thresholds and `budgetCapStopCondition` are silently bypassed,
weakening BYOK cost protection exactly on failed attempts. Related traps in the
same PR: routing complex/fallback turns through a model priced only at the _low_
prompt-size tier under-estimates large-context spend, and promoting fallback
attempts back to the `programming` tier re-triggers the failures fallback exists
to avoid.

**Preventive checks.**

- Match priced model IDs by **exact ID or hyphen-suffixed family prefix**, and
  add coverage for dated/aliased variants.
- Provide a **conservative fallback rate** for unknown IDs (especially
  user-supplied OpenRouter overrides) so failed attempts always contribute spend.
- For enforcement paths (budget cap, circuit breaker), price with the
  **worst-case / high prompt-size tier**, not the cheapest tier.
- Keep fallback routing pinned to the selected fallback tier; don't let a tool
  call escalate a fallback turn back onto the tier it was escaping.
- Keep `docs/ai/model-policy.md` aligned with the rates the runtime estimator
  actually enforces.

## 4. Derive watchdog/sweep timers from the action cap, not optimistic guesses

**Seen in:** #412

**Problem.** The stuck-message watchdog was scheduled _before_ provider
resolution, prompt/context building, and `streamWithRetry` (three 180s
attempts). The assistant row for the final attempt could be created more than
five minutes after the timer started; if that attempt was then killed by the
600s action cap, the single sweep saw the row as younger than
`STUCK_MESSAGE_GRACE_MS`, skipped it, and queued no later sweep — leaving the
spinner stuck indefinitely.

**Why it matters.** A self-healing mechanism that can fire before the thing it
heals exists (or before it has aged into the grace window) silently fails on
exactly the slow/retried turns it was built for.

**Preventive checks.**

- Derive sweep delays from the **Convex action cap**
  (`CONVEX_ACTION_MAX_MS = 10m`): set `GRACE = cap + margin` and
  `WATCHDOG_DELAY = grace + cap + margin`, so even a final-attempt row created at
  the very end of the action's life has aged past the grace window before the
  sweep fires.
- Add a regression test asserting the invariant (e.g.
  `WATCHDOG_DELAY - GRACE > CONVEX_ACTION_MAX_MS`) so it can't silently regress.
- Prefer a single larger fixed delay over self-rescheduling to keep the sweep
  stateless — but if you keep it single-shot, prove the timing window covers the
  worst-case retry path.

## 5. Error boundaries around optional integrations must recover and log

**Seen in:** #426 (2 review threads, both P2)

**Problem.** A new React error boundary wrapped the optional Garmin
"send-to-Garmin" card on the schedule detail page so a failure there couldn't
take down the whole route. But the boundary had two gaps:

- **No recovery.** It set `hasError` once on a `workoutPlanId:date` key and then
  returned `null` forever. A _transient_ `useQuery` failure (auth/session
  refresh, a momentary Convex query error) permanently hid the controls until
  the route remounted or the user navigated away — even though the query would
  have recovered on its own.
- **No logging.** It swallowed the render/query error without a
  `componentDidCatch` (or other) log path. Because it also stopped the app-level
  `ErrorBoundary` from seeing the error, a Garmin regression looked
  indistinguishable from "the optional integration is simply absent" — operators
  lost the only signal that the card was failing.

**Why it matters.** An error boundary added _for resilience_ can quietly make
things worse: it converts a recoverable, observable failure into a permanent,
invisible one. The integration appears gone rather than broken, so neither the
user nor Sentry/operators ever learn it regressed.

**Preventive checks.**

- Give every error boundary a **recovery path**: a retry control that resets the
  boundary state (or render from local safe query state) so a transient failure
  clears when the underlying query recovers. Don't latch `hasError` for the life
  of the key.
- Always **log the caught error** in `componentDidCatch` (or equivalent) with a
  named message, even when you intentionally keep the rest of the page visible —
  a boundary that hides a card must not also hide the signal.
- When a boundary deliberately stops the app-level `ErrorBoundary` from seeing an
  error, it owns the observability for that subtree. Confirm the error still
  reaches the logs.
- Add regression coverage for the **recovery** transition (toggle the mocked
  query failure → success and assert the card returns), not just the
  failure-hides-card case.

## 6. Validate new credential/ID formats against a real example, and update every copy of the check

**Seen in:** #417 (P1)

**Problem.** The PR existed to unblock Google "Express Mode" Gemini keys, which
are issued with an `AQ.` prefix (e.g. `AQ.Ab8...`). The validation regex allowed
only `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` immediately after `AQ`, so it rejected the literal dot —
meaning the change failed to accept the exact key format it was written to
support. The same regex was **duplicated in three places** (`convex/ai/providers.ts`,
the `prepareGeminiKeyForStorage` storage helper, and the client-side
`ApiKeyForm`); the dot had to be added to all three or the key would still fail
at one layer.

**Why it matters.** A validator written from an assumed format rather than a real
sample silently defeats its own purpose — the feature ships "done" but the
target input still bounces. And when the same rule is copied across client +
storage + provider layers, fixing one copy leaves the others to reject the input
at a different boundary, which is hard to diagnose.

**Preventive checks.**

- Before changing a format validator (API-key prefix, ID pattern, sentinel),
  paste a **real, full example** of the target value and confirm the
  pattern/branch actually accepts it end-to-end — don't infer the charset.
- Grep for **every copy** of the validation rule (client form, storage helper,
  provider/server check) and update them together; add a matching test in each
  file so a future divergence is caught. Consider whether the duplicated regex
  should be a single shared constant.
- Add a positive test using the literal target format (here, an `AQ.`-prefixed
  key) at each validation layer.

## 7. When a transform filters elements out of a payload, keep counts and structural markers consistent — and guard the empty result

**Seen in:** #440 (3 review threads: 1 P2, 2 P3, plus a CodeRabbit P2)

**Problem.** `buildTonalWorkoutSets` started dropping synthetic movements (e.g.
injected `Rest` sentinels) from the Tonal payload, but the rest of the push path
wasn't updated to match the filtered list:

- **Empty result wasn't guarded.** A block containing only synthetic movements
  filtered down to `[]`, yet `pushWorkoutToTonal` still POSTed the empty `sets`
  to `/v6/user-workouts`. Tonal returned a misleading 400 and `createWorkout`
  recorded a failed plan — instead of failing fast locally with a clear error
  (the estimate path already rejected empty payloads; the push path didn't).
- **Count came from the unfiltered source.** `createWorkout` reported `setCount`
  from a separate unfiltered `expandBlocksToSets(blocks)` calculation, so a
  3-work-set + 3-rest-sentinel block reported 6 sets pushed while only 3 reached
  Tonal — the user/LLM-visible success message overstated the result.
- **A structural marker was lost with the element it sat on.** When a block began
  with a synthetic movement, filtering removed the only set marked
  `blockStart: true`, so the first _real_ set went out as `blockStart: false` and
  the Tonal payload's block boundaries no longer matched the validated block
  structure.

**Why it matters.** A filter step that drops elements quietly desynchronizes
everything derived from the original list — counts, boundary markers, and the
"is there anything left?" precondition. The failures surface as opaque remote
errors or wrong user-facing numbers, far from the filter that caused them.

**Preventive checks.**

- After filtering, **guard the empty result** and fail fast locally with a
  descriptive error _before_ constructing/sending the remote payload — don't let
  an external API translate "nothing to send" into a confusing 4xx.
- Derive **counts and summaries from the post-filter list**, never from a
  parallel unfiltered calculation of the same data.
- **Re-establish structural anchors** (block starts, "first"/"last" flags,
  ordinal indices) on the filtered list when the element that carried them can be
  removed — or reject inputs that would place a marker on a droppable element.
- Add coverage for the **all-dropped** case and the **leading-element-dropped**
  case, not just the happy middle.

## 8. Preserve the concrete error class through fallback layers, and emit time-sensitive alerts before long awaits

**Seen in:** #434 (2 review threads, both P2)

**Problem.** Adding fallback context to the circuit-breaker alert introduced two
gaps:

- **The terminal error class was flattened.** When a fallback attempt ended with
  `{ done: true, success: false }` for a _known_ non-transient class (BYOK,
  quota, etc.), the alert reported a generic `TerminalFallbackAttemptFailure`
  instead of the real class `resilience.ts` had already identified — losing the
  diagnosis exactly when fallback fails for a knowable reason.
- **A notification was awaited behind a long operation.** The breaker-open alert
  was delayed until after the final fallback attempt finished. With each attempt
  budgeting 180s under Convex's 600s action cap, two primary timeouts plus the
  fallback could run close enough to the cap that the action is killed before the
  notification is ever sent — even though the breaker had already opened.

**Why it matters.** Observability degrades precisely on the worst failures: the
alert that should explain a terminal failure either misreports the cause or never
fires because the action died first.

**Preventive checks.**

- Carry the **concrete error class** through your `AttemptOutcome`/result type and
  use it for _both_ primary and fallback terminal notifications — don't substitute
  a generic sentinel when the real class is already known.
- Emit **minimal state-change alerts (breaker-open, etc.) before** awaiting a long
  final operation; record the operation's outcome in a _separate_ follow-up or a
  best-effort `finally`, so an action killed at the cap still surfaces the state
  change. (See also §4 — budget all timing against `CONVEX_ACTION_MAX_MS`.)
- Add a regression test asserting the alert is sent **before** the final fallback
  await, and that a known terminal class propagates into the alert payload.

## 9. Type external fields as nullable to match the real payload, and don't let connect-time normalization clobber stored values on refresh

**Seen in:** #429 (1 P2 review thread + 1 CodeRabbit Major)

**Problem.** Normalizing Tonal sub-account profile data surfaced two issues:

- **The type lied about the payload.** `TonalUser` declared `heightInches`,
  `weightPounds`, and `workoutsPerWeek` as non-nullable `number`, but the mapper
  already did `?? 0` and a test fed `null` for these fields — Tonal really does
  return `null`. The interface said the null case couldn't happen while the code
  handled it, hiding the null-handling contract from every consumer.
- **Connect-time normalization ran destructively on refresh.** The `?? 0`
  fallback is necessary for first-time-connect validation, but it also ran on
  refresh/backfill — and `updateProfileData` replaces the whole stored
  `profileData`. So a user with real height/weight/frequency could be **downgraded
  to `0`** when a later Tonal payload merely said those values were unknown, and
  the zeros then leaked into AI context (`0"/0lbs`, `0x/week`).

**Why it matters.** A type that doesn't model the real nullable shape lets
null-handling bugs through silently. And a normalization default that's safe at
first-connect becomes _data corruption_ on refresh — "value unknown right now"
must never overwrite a previously known value.

**Preventive checks.**

- Type external/API fields as `number | null` (etc.) to **match what the payload
  actually sends**; cross-check the mapper's `?? ` fallbacks and any test that
  passes `null`. If you're defaulting a value, the source type is probably
  nullable.
- Distinguish **first-time-connect normalization from refresh/backfill**. On
  refresh, fall back to the **existing stored value** before any hardcoded default,
  and never replace a known value with a default derived from a "value unknown"
  payload.
- Add a regression test asserting refresh **preserves stored measurements** when
  the latest payload returns `null` for those fields.

## 10. Changing a route's tier ripples to the derived fallback tier — and retrospective escalation won't fix the first tool call

**Seen in:** #469 (4 review threads, all P2)

**Problem.** A change rerouted short/"trivial" chat turns onto the tool-capable
`chat` tier to fix workouts silently not being created. Two coupled traps:

- **The fallback tier rides along on the primary tier.** `selectCoachTierRoute`
  derives the fallback via `getFallbackTier(primaryTier)`, and
  `getFallbackTier("chat")` is the router/flash-lite tier, which does not reliably
  drive `search_exercises → create_workout`. So on a transient failure or an
  already-open circuit, `runAttempt(fallbackAgent)` handled the request on
  flash-lite and reintroduced the exact no-workout behavior the PR was closing.
  Naively "fixing" this by making `getFallbackTier("chat")` return `programming`
  then collapsed the **distinct-model** fallback on the default Gemini policy
  (where `chat == programming == gemini-2.5-flash`), so a flash outage / circuit
  trip lost its only alternate model (flash-lite). Tool-capable-fallback and
  distinct-model-fallback cannot both hold on Gemini without a model-policy change.
- **Deleting the whole classifier gate dropped unrelated routing.** The first
  attempt removed the entire intent classifier, which silently also dropped
  `complex → programming` routing. The `prepareStep` escalation in
  `convex/ai/coach.ts` is **retrospective** — it switches to `programming` only
  _after_ a prior step already used a programming tool — so the first planning
  tool call for BYOK Claude/OpenAI "program a week" requests ran on the chat tier
  (Sonnet / GPT-mini) instead of the configured programming tier (Opus / GPT-5.4).

**Why it matters.** Routing logic has coupled side effects: the fallback tier is
_derived_ from the primary tier you change, and "escalate later" mechanisms don't
help the first tool call. A broad deletion to fix one branch silently weakens
unrelated routing the policy reserves a tier for — exactly the high-value requests
that tier exists to protect.

**Preventive checks.**

- When you change which tier a route's _primary_ uses, trace the **derived
  fallback** (`getFallbackTier`) too and confirm it still satisfies the property
  you depend on (tool-capable _and/or_ distinct-model) on **every** provider
  policy — especially the default Gemini policy, where chat and programming
  collapse to the same model. State explicitly which property the fallback must
  preserve, and flag when the two conflict so the maintainer can choose.
- Prefer a **surgical reroute of the specific branch** (trivial → chat) over
  deleting the whole classifier gate. Deleting a gate drops _every_ routing
  decision it made, not just the buggy one.
- Don't rely on retrospective `prepareStep` escalation to land the **first** tool
  call on the right tier; pick the correct starting tier up front for requests the
  policy reserves the programming tier for.
- Add a regression assertion for the invariant you care about (e.g. the default
  route's `fallbackTier` is never `router`, or that an explicit "program a week"
  request starts on the programming tier).

## 11. A newly-required field or tightened matcher must still admit exempt sentinels and exact catalog names — and never let a stale ID beat the right name

**Seen in:** #465 (4 review threads, all P2)

**Problem.** `create_workout` was hardened to require a movement `name` (to repair
missing/wrong IDs) and to resolve names against the Tonal catalog. Four gaps:

- **Stale ID won over the correct name.** When both `name` and `movementId` were
  supplied, a valid-but-stale ID resolved immediately and the name was never
  checked — so an LLM that reused a real ID from another exercise while giving the
  correct new name silently pushed the **wrong** Tonal movement, defeating the
  whole reason `name` was made required.
- **Broad fuzzy matches were auto-substituted.** A lone strict-fuzzy match (any
  3+ char word appearing in a movement name) was silently pushed, so
  `Decline Push-up` could resolve to `Standing Decline Chest Press` and land the
  wrong exercise. A single fuzzy match must be returned as a **candidate**
  (`ambiguous`), not auto-resolved.
- **Full-name vs shortName alias collision.** When a requested name exactly
  equalled one movement's full `name` _and_ another's `shortName`, both rows were
  combined and returned `ambiguous`, blocking an unambiguous valid call. Exact
  matching must be **staged**: full names first, fall back to `shortName` aliases
  only when no full-name match exists.
- **A required field rejected an exempt sentinel.** Making `name` required at the
  Zod tool-schema layer rejected the documented synthetic `Rest` sentinel
  (supplied by `movementId` only, catalog-exempt, cannot come from
  `search_exercises`) **before** `resolveMovement`'s `isWellKnownMovementId` path
  could run — so single-exercise workouts that included Rest failed unless the
  model invented a `name`.

**Why it matters.** Tightening an input contract or matcher to fix the common case
can silently reject legitimate edge inputs (exempt sentinels, exact catalog names)
and prefer the **wrong source of truth** (stale ID over correct name, broad fuzzy
over exact). The failures land as wrong exercises pushed to the user's machine, or
valid tool calls that bounce.

**Preventive checks.**

- When both an ID and a human name are supplied, **verify the exact name before
  trusting the ID**; reject or re-resolve on an ID/name mismatch rather than
  letting a stale or copied ID win.
- **Auto-resolve only on exact matches** (full name, then `shortName` alias as a
  staged fallback, plus valid/well-known IDs). Return partial/fuzzy/single-word
  matches as candidates for confirmation — never silently substitute one.
- When you make a tool-schema field required (or otherwise tighten a validator),
  **enumerate the documented exempt/sentinel inputs** (e.g. `Rest`) and confirm
  they still pass the schema before the resolver's special-case path runs — keep
  the field optional or special-case the sentinel at the schema layer.
- Add coverage for each trap: stale-ID-vs-correct-name, broad-fuzzy-not-
  substituted, full-name-beats-shortName, and the exempt-sentinel path.

## How to use this log

- Before opening a PR that touches **Tonal fetch helpers, AI cost/budget paths,
  test fixtures, scheduled sweeps, React error boundaries around optional
  integrations, credential/format validators, payload transforms that
  filter/drop elements, retry/fallback error reporting, external-payload
  normalization (nullable typing, refresh vs. first-connect defaults), AI
  tier/route selection and its derived fallback tier, or movement/identifier
  resolution and tool-schema input contracts**, skim the matching section above.
- When a review surfaces a _new_ recurring, legitimate gap (not stylistic, not
  one-off), add an entry here with the PR reference so the next agent inherits
  the lesson.
