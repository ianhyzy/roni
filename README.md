> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Not affiliated with Tonal Systems, Inc.** Roni is an independent, unofficial tool that works with Tonal fitness machines. "Tonal" is a trademark of Tonal Systems, Inc., used here under nominative fair use. This project is not endorsed by, sponsored by, or associated with Tonal Systems, Inc. in any way.

## What this is

Roni is an AI coaching companion for Tonal fitness machines. Connect your Tonal account, and the app reads your training history, strength scores, and workout data to program custom weekly workout plans. The coach uses Google Gemini models to select exercises, manage periodization, and push approved workouts directly to Tonal with no manual builder work. It is built on Next.js and Convex with real-time sync.

## Who it's for

This project is open-source for two reasons: technical users who want to self-host their own copy on free-tier infrastructure, and anyone who wants to audit the code to understand exactly how their Tonal credentials and workout data are handled. The code is the answer to "are you storing my password?"

## How the open-source model works

**Self-host.** Clone the repo, spin up a Convex deployment, set the required server secrets, and run locally or deploy to Vercel. You control the infrastructure, secrets, and data handling. Instructions are in the Self-Host Setup section below.

**Operator-managed deployments.** The codebase supports both a shared server-side Gemini key and per-user bring-your-own-key (BYOK) storage. Which mode is enforced is a deployment policy decision, not something the public repo can guarantee for any specific hosted instance.

## Features

- AI chat coach powered by Google Gemini with Tonal-specific tools - reads your Tonal history, programs workouts, explains decisions
- Custom weekly training plans with periodization (Building, Deload, and Testing blocks)
- Exercise selection based on your equipment, goals, and injury history
- Progressive overload tracking across sessions
- Injury and mobility constraint management
- One-click workout push directly to your Tonal - no manual entry
- Shared-key and bring-your-own-key (BYOK) support

## Stack

| Layer      | Technology                                           |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

| Deployment | Vercel (web), Convex (backend)                       |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 (matches `.nvmrc`; Node.js 20+ should also work)
- npm
- A [Convex](https://convex.dev) account (free tier works)
- A [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) API key for the server-side Gemini integration
- A [Resend](https://resend.com) account + API key (optional - only needed for password reset OTP emails)
- A Tonal account to test the integration end-to-end

## Self-Host Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeffOtano/roni.git roni
cd roni
npm install
npm run setup        # interactive: bootstraps Convex, generates secrets, prompts for optional integrations

# In two separate terminals:
npx convex dev       # terminal 1
npm run dev          # terminal 2

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

`npm run setup` walks you through Convex deployment creation, generates `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `EMAIL_CHANGE_CODE_PEPPER`, and the JWT keypair, and prompts for optional integrations (Resend, Discord webhooks, PostHog, Sentry). It is safe to re-run - existing values are preserved unless you choose to overwrite them.

By default, self-hosted deployments start with analytics, Sentry, and the public contact form disabled. Those integrations are opt-in and can be enabled during `npm run setup` or by setting the variables below.

## AI Observability & Evals

Full AI traces (user messages, system instructions, training snapshots, tool args/results, assistant outputs, token/latency metadata) stream to Phoenix Cloud via OpenTelemetry. Set `PHOENIX_API_KEY` in the Convex backend to enable capture. Product analytics continue to flow to PostHog. See [docs/trust-model.md](docs/trust-model.md#what-the-app-sends-to-third-parties) for what data leaves the backend and what is scrubbed before it does.

- `aiRun.runId` matches the Phoenix trace id for each user turn so dashboards can join on it.
- `aiToolCalls` stores per-tool args and a bounded result preview for post-hoc tool analysis.
- Eval scenarios live in `convex/ai/evalScenarios.ts` and drive both local `vitest` runs and the Phoenix smoke suite under `scripts/evals/phoenix/`.

### GitHub Actions secrets

Two workflows exercise the coach and need repo secrets configured under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- `ci.yml` → `AI prompt smoke evals` job (runs on every PR)
- `ai-evals-nightly.yml` → `Phoenix agent experiment` job (runs nightly at 04:17 UTC)

| Secret                         | Required?                                  | Notes                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` | Required for real runs                     | Smoke script soft-fails (exit 0) when missing so fork PRs without access to secrets don't block merges. |
| `PHOENIX_API_KEY`              | Required for traces to reach Phoenix Cloud | Nightly experiment fails hard without it.                                                               |
| `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT`   | Optional                                   | Defaults to `https://app.phoenix.arize.com`.                                                            |
| `PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME`         | Optional                                   | Defaults to `roni-coach`; segments traces in the Phoenix UI.                                            |
| `PHOENIX_HOST`                 | Optional                                   | Alternate host; `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` takes precedence when both are set.                        |

Fork PRs inherit no secrets by design. The smoke job detects a missing `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` and skips gracefully; the nightly workflow runs only on the base repo, so fork contributors don't need to worry about it.

## Testing

Vitest with two projects: `backend` (Node environment, `convex/**/*.test.ts`) and `frontend` (jsdom, `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`). Test files are co-located next to source files.

```bash
npm test                              # all tests
npx vitest --project backend          # backend only
npx vitest --project frontend         # frontend only
npx vitest run convex/stats.test.ts   # single file
npm run test:e2e                      # Playwright smoke tests
```

Coverage thresholds are enforced in CI. Lint is also treated as a hard gate: warnings fail CI.

## Deployment

### Web App (Vercel + Convex)

```
npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'
```

This is the build-command pattern used for Vercel deployments: deploy the Convex backend first, then run the Next.js production build.

**Setup:**

1. Connect the GitHub repo to a [Vercel](https://vercel.com) project
2. Set the following environment variables in Vercel project settings:
   - `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` - get from Convex dashboard (Settings > Deploy keys)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - your production Convex URL (`https://<name>.convex.cloud`)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO_URL` - optional, enables the OSS banner in production
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_FORM_ENABLED` - optional, set to `true` only if `DISCORD_CONTACT_WEBHOOK` is configured
   - PostHog variables if using analytics (`NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`)
   - Sentry variables if using error tracking (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`)
3. Set production secrets in the Convex dashboard (same keys as the env table above, with production values)
4. Push to `main` - Vercel auto-deploys on every push

### Convex backend only

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

## Architecture

### Core Data Flow

```
Tonal API --> [encrypted tokens] --> Convex proxy/cache layer --> Convex DB
                                                                     |
                                                                     v
User (chat) --> send message --> AI Coach Agent (Gemini, tool-driven) --> reads context
                                                                     |
                                                          creates workoutPlans (draft)
                                                                     |
                                                          user approves --> push to Tonal API
```

### AI Coach

The coach uses `@convex-dev/agent` with a tiered provider policy. The shared-key Gemini path uses `gemini-3.6-flash` for chat and programming, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` for routing and summarization, and the server-side Google AI key for embeddings. BYOK users can select Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, or OpenRouter; the current tier defaults are documented in the [AI model policy](./docs/ai/model-policy.md). Tool-driven capabilities include:

- Read Tonal training history, strength scores, and workout data
- Create and modify weekly workout plans with periodization
- Select exercises based on equipment and training goals
- Manage goals, injuries, and training preferences
- Push approved workouts directly to Tonal

**Shared key + BYOK:** The Gemini provider is resolved per request. The repo supports both a shared server-side key and encrypted per-user BYOK storage. Whether BYOK is required is controlled by deployment policy in [`convex/byok.ts`](./convex/byok.ts); failed BYOK requests error explicitly instead of silently falling back.

### Tonal API Integration

- OAuth tokens encrypted with AES-256 at rest
- Cron refreshes expiring tokens every 30 minutes
- `withTokenRetry` pattern: try with current token, on 401 refresh and retry once
- Proxy layer with stale-while-revalidate caching to minimize API calls
- Circuit breaker pattern for API health tracking

### Scheduled Jobs
