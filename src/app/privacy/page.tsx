          <p>
            Roni is an independent project built by an individual developer. It is not affiliated
            with, endorsed by, or connected to Tonal in any way. Tonal is a trademark of Tonal
            Systems, Inc. This service uses Tonal&apos;s APIs to read your training data and push
            custom workouts to your machine, but Tonal does not provide a public API or officially
            support third-party integrations.

            Tonal account credentials
          </h2>
          <p>
            When you connect your Tonal account, your email and password are sent to Tonal&apos;s
            authentication system (Auth0) to obtain an access token. Your password is used once for
            this request and is not stored, logged, or retained in any form. The resulting
            authentication token and refresh token are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before being
            stored in our database. These tokens allow the service to read your data and push
            workouts on your behalf.

          <h2 className="mb-2 text-base font-semibold text-foreground">AI and third parties</h2>
          <p>
            Chat conversations are processed by Google&apos;s Gemini AI model to generate coaching
            responses. Your training data is included in the AI context so the coach can give
            personalized advice. When you connect Fitbit, this context may include Fitbit activity,
            sleep, resting heart rate, and HRV summaries. Google&apos;s AI usage policies apply to
            this processing. Roni does not train its own AI model on your data.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The service is hosted on Convex (database and backend) and Vercel (frontend). PostHog
            receives product usage analytics and account identifiers including your internal user
            ID, email, and name when available. Sentry receives application errors and diagnostics;
            default collection of personally identifiable information is disabled. We do not sell
            this data or use it for advertising.

            Garmin Connect integration
          </h2>
          <p>
            Connecting Garmin Connect is optional. When you connect, Roni uses Garmin&apos;s
            official Activity API and Health API so the AI coach can factor rides, runs, and other
            non-Tonal sessions into your training plan. Roni is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
            sponsored by Garmin. Garmin and Garmin Connect are trademarks of Garmin Ltd.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The connection uses Garmin&apos;s OAuth 1.0a user-authorized flow. You enter your Garmin
            username and password on Garmin&apos;s own site; those credentials are never sent to or
            seen by Roni. Garmin returns a long-lived access token and access token secret, both of
            which are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being written to our database.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            During the handshake we may request the following Garmin permissions. You decide which
            to grant, and you can change them any time from your Garmin Connect account settings:
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-inside list-disc space-y-1">
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">ACTIVITY_EXPORT</span> — lets Garmin
              send summaries of your completed activities (workouts, runs, rides, and similar
              sessions) to Roni so the coach can account for non-Tonal training.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">HEALTH_EXPORT</span> — lets Garmin send
              daily wellness summaries (such as sleep, stress, resting heart rate, HRV, body
              battery, and steps) to Roni so the coach can factor recovery and readiness into your
              plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">WORKOUT_IMPORT</span> — lets Roni send
              coach-generated workouts from Roni to your Garmin device.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            We store only the summary data Garmin sends us — activity metrics such as activity type,
            start time, duration, distance, elevation gain, pace, calories, and heart rate, and
            daily wellness rollups such as sleep, stress, resting heart rate, HRV, body battery, and
            step counts. We do not store GPS tracks, per-second samples, or route details. Raw
            webhook payloads are retained briefly — currently up to 14 days — for operational replay
            and error recovery, then automatically deleted.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            When you first connect, Roni may request a limited initial backfill of your recent
            history (currently up to 30 days of activities) so the coach has context from the start.
            After that, Garmin pushes new data to Roni automatically as it is recorded — we do not
            poll or scrape your account.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            We do not sell, rent, or share Garmin data with advertisers, data brokers, or any other
            third party. Garmin data is used inside Roni only to power the coach, and it is
            processed under the same infrastructure and AI terms described in the &ldquo;AI and
            third parties&rdquo; section above.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            You can disconnect Garmin at any time from the Settings page in Roni, which asks Garmin
            to remove Roni&apos;s registration and marks the connection inactive so no further
            webhooks are processed. You can also revoke Roni&apos;s access directly from your Garmin
            Connect account settings; Garmin sends us a deregistration webhook and we mark the
            connection disconnected in response. Deleting your Roni account additionally removes all
            stored Garmin connection records, activity summaries, wellness summaries, and
            webhook-event log entries.

            Fitbit via Google Health integration
          </h2>
          <p>
            Connecting Fitbit is optional. Roni uses the official Google Health API in read-only
            mode so the AI coach can account for cross-training and recovery. Roni is not affiliated
            with or endorsed by Google or Fitbit.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Authorization happens on Google&apos;s site. Your Google password is never sent to or
            seen by Roni. Google returns access and refresh tokens, which Roni encrypts with
            AES-256-GCM before storing. Roni requests read-only access to activity and fitness,
            sleep, and health metrics and measurements; it does not request permission to write
            health data.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Roni imports only records identified by Google Health as originating from Fitbit or the
            legacy Fitbit Web API. The initial and recurring sync window is currently up to 30 days.
            Stored summaries can include workout type, time, duration, distance, pace, calories,
            average heart rate, sleep duration and stages, resting heart rate, and daily HRV. Roni
            does not store GPS tracks or per-second heart-rate samples from Google Health.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Fitbit data flows one way into Roni and is used only to personalize coaching under the
            same infrastructure and AI terms described above. Roni polls Google Health periodically
            for updates and does not write workouts or other data back to Fitbit.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Disconnecting Fitbit marks the connection inactive, removes the encrypted credentials
            from active use, asks Google to revoke Roni&apos;s grant, and starts removing data
            imported under that connection. If Google revocation fails, Roni shows a warning and you
            can revoke access directly in your Google account. Deleting your Roni account removes
            stored Fitbit connection records, OAuth artifacts, activity summaries, and wellness
            summaries; Roni also attempts to revoke an active Google grant during account deletion.

        <section>
          <h2 className="mb-2 text-base font-semibold text-foreground">Data deletion</h2>
          <p>
            You can disconnect your Tonal account and delete your Roni account at any time. Account
            deletion removes your Roni account and associated application records from active
            storage. Revocation requests to connected providers can fail, so you can also revoke
            access directly in each provider&apos;s account settings.
